# Refactor_Iac-Terraform-_using_Modules-xviii

Implement AWS Cloud Solution for a web service Using A Reverse Proxy (Nginx)
This build a secure infrastructure using Terraform and refactoring the Iac using Modules.
S3 bucket was used for the backend and dynamoDb to store the state lock files.
I ensured infrastructure for the service is resilient, highly available and can accomodate to increased traffic.
